    <h4>How To Play</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Pairs of gems, called <strong>Active Gems</strong> appear at the top of your board and descend towards the bottom.</p></li>
      <li><p>You can move and rotate <strong>Active Gems</strong> using the arrow keys, mouse, touchscreen, or gamepad.</p></li>
      <li><p>Try to set gems next to gems of the same color, forming <strong>Runs</strong>. Some gems that drop are round. These are <strong>Crash Gems</strong>.</p></li>
      <li><p>The goal is to combine <strong>Runs</strong> of like-colored gems with <strong>Crash Gems</strong> of the same color.</p></li>
      <li><p>When you crash <strong>Runs</strong> of gems, you get points, and drop <strong>Timer Gems</strong> on your targeted opponent.</p></li>
      <li><p>Every time you drop your <strong>Active Gems</strong>, the number on <strong>Timer Gems</strong> decreases, until they become normal gems.</p></li>
      <li><p>If you're facing more than one opponent, you can target any one of them using the number keys or by clicking or tapping their board.</p></li>
      <li><p>If gems fill your board, you lose. If you (or your teammate) are the last player standing, you win!</p></li>
